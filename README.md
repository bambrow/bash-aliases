# Bash Aliases

This repository collects my commonly used Bash aliases. To use these aliases, simply copy them into the `~/.bashrc` file.

The following are my personal suggestions:
- Put Bash aliases into `~/.bashrc` file
- Put `PATH` settings into `~/.profile` file
- Put the following lines into `~/.bash_profile` file:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
source ~/.profile
```
